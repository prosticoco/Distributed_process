    Fair-loss link:
        Fair-loss: if a msg is sent infinitely
          often by pi to pj and none of them crashes
          then the msg is delivered infinitely often to pj.
        Finite duplication: if a msg m is sent a finite number
          of times by pi to pj, then the msg is delivered a
          finite number of times by pj.
        No creation: no msg is delivered unless it was sent.


    Reliable (Perfect) link:
        Validity: if pi and pj are correct then every msg sent by
          pi to pj is eventually delivered by pj
        No duplication: No msg is delivered more than once
        No creation
